# My data comes from CDC: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-in-the-United-St/kn79-hsxy
# As some counties were missing in this dataset, I added their name by using excel.
# Then I opened the dataset in Python. 
# 1. I dropped "Date as of", "First week" and "Last week" coloums.
